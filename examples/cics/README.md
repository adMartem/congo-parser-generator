# CICS Grammar 

This grammar for a sample subset of the IBM CICS command language is, as far as I can tell, completely 100% correct, up to CICS ???.

You may use this grammar freely in your own projects, though it would be nice if you acknowledged your use and provided a link to the CongoCC project.
